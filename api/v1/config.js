The website is not optimized for smaller views (i.e. mobile) but someone can submit a pull request for styling it. Constructive feedback, bug reports, and feature requests on all parts is appreciated and can be submited via an issue on this GitHub repo. Please find that I wrote the new website using a clean and minimalist design approach and it may take some time to learn to navigate it if you are used to the old website. Pages can be found in the menu by clicking the icon in the top left corner. If you're an artist and would like to contribute some designs to the website please create a ticket or PR with designs.

It is a normal reaction to be on a wall. But climbing through tight spaces without oils and powders without aggro is obviously a bug and you will be banned for it.)',
