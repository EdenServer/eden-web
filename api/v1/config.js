        "Eden's new and improved website and tools are now live with **Godmode's** redesign.

      message:
        'We have heard your voices about crash related issues on Eden, especially with **Dynamis** and **Assault** zones and are still working to shore up a few more of them. It is taking an extended period to resolve the problems because we cannot reproduce them in test and need to explore code fixes over time. There are several expected crash fixes live right now and we are gathering data on their effectiveness. In the next few weeks, we hope to conclude our focused crash investigations, and then get back to more new content and more bug fixes.',

      message:
        'A new system has been implemented to provide existing players and staff a way to obtain registration codes for new players.  \n  \nThe purpose of this system is to prevent abuse of account creation. Similar to `!unstuck`, the `!getcode` command may be used by any player meeting both of the following criteria:  \n  \n- accumulated 120 hours (5 days) of playtime and  \n- main job level 15 or greater.  \n  \nThe `!getcode` command will return a **5 digit, one-time use registration code** that should be given to new players wishing to create an account (or existing players wishing to create alternate accounts). When a registration code is successfully used to create an account, a new code will take its place.  \n  \nExisting players providing registration codes to new players will not be punished if the new player becomes banned for rule violations. However, requesting a registration code repeatedly for the purpose of mass account creation is prohibited, even if done over the course of several weeks.',

      message:
        'Pursuant to the announcement of Eden to be more welcoming / forgiving of player transgressions, we are opening up an appeals processes for players whose accounts were permanently banned due to being linked to another account that was found guilty of committing bannable offenses.  \n  \nThe account belonging to the character caught breaking rules will always experience the punishment appropriate for the rule that was broken, regardless of which person was in control at the time. We highly recommend you do not share your account under any circumstances.  \n  \nThe burden of proof is on the player(s) involved. It will be up to them to provide adequate proof that it was a different person who was caught cheating AND that you were unaware / had no reasonable way of suspecting that player may have been cheating. You should not be sharing an account with someone whom you know is cheating, or even someone whom you suspect might be cheating. If you later discover they are cheating and have previously shared your account with them, report this behavior immediately via in-game helpdesk ticket. Reporting this behavior when you discover it is encouraged and will drastically improve your chances of a favorable outcome.  \n  \nAt this time we are only considering appeals for accounts which were granted permanent bans due to being linked to the account of an offender.  \n  \nAppeals can be directed to [gmteam.edenxi@gmail.com](mailto:gmteam.edenxi@gmail.com)',

To clarify, reasonable is up to the GM team's discretion, holding to recover from a wipe is allowed, intention to kill with reinforcements on the way isn't holding, and Darters in Dragon's Aery may be held alive 5 minutes from time of claim. Please see Discord and ask a GM for more information if you need it.",
