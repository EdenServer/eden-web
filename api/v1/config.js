        'Using a non-Eden bootloader--including using a modified version of the Eden bootloader--is NOT allowed. The bootloader must be downloaded from the official site or #annoucements channel in our official Discord otherwise there are no guarantees it is official.',
        'Until a technical solution is implemented, no more than 8 monsters may be intentionally gathered to kill at the same time.',
        'If something feels like it is broken, either not like it was on era retail or a potential exploit or too overpowered. (read: if something seems like it was not intentional from the development team) report it. Knowingly taking advantage of these activities is NOT allowed.',
        'Each player is only allowed to have 2 characters logged in and active, with an additional third character confined to a city and idle. This character may only be used to bazaar or mule items while your other characters are logged in. (This will not be locked down by IP, but it will be actively patrolled.) Tri-boxing 3 or more active characters is NOT allowed.',
        'Claim bots, modifying dats to claim, any type of targeting using mob id (such as /target 12345678) or using any other third party tools such as Shorthand or its Windower equivalent to claim is NOT allowed.',
        "Any scripts, bots, or addons that automate actions are NOT allowed. Macros using the /wait or <wait> feature within the game are OK. (Such as /lastsynth macros up to the game's maximum of 6 lines.)",
        "Account sharing is strongly discouraged and may be disallowed in the future. If one or more of your accounts are linked to a player that is caught cheating by either logging into an offending player's account or by that player logging into one of your accounts you will share the same punishment as the cheater--which is 9 out of 10 times a permanent ban.",
        'Not really a rule but be aware that players may be limited in the future to 3 characters. So create new ones at your own risk. It is undecided how additional characters would be handled if we imposed these limits.',
        'Using known bugs (including terrain) or unpatched exploits to your advantage in a way that would not be possible in retail. For example: purposefully crawling on walls to avoid aggro using the current navmesh’s bugs is NOT allowed. (Note: this does not mean people are exploiting because they are standing on walls. It is a normal reaction to be on a wall. But climbing through tight spaces without oils and powders without aggro is obviously a bug and you will be banned for it.)',
        'Testing known or possible exploits on the live server is not allowed unless permission is given from Godmode first. Like every other rule this includes GMs and developers too.',
        "Holding a monster for the purpose of grieving other players or monopolizing the time it spawns is NOT allowed (note that since determining a player's intent is highly subjective to the GM addressing the ticket, if asked to begin damage by a GM you must start fighting the monster within a reasonable amount of time or you will forfeit the claim)",
        "Reasonable is up to the GM team's discretion.",
        'Holding to recover from a wipe is allowed.',
        "Intention to kill with reinforcements on the way isn't holding.",
        "Not so much a rule either but if you are aware of any non-era item/NM/recipe/et cetera please report it. And do expect the rewards obtained from it to be removed. I can't find every non-era thing at once but as I find them I will be removing them.",
        'Creating characters for the purpose of market manipulation is NOT allowed.',
        'Gardening is only allowed on up to 3 characters. (30 total plants.)',
        'Hacking/exploiting/cheating of any kind including but not limited to buying items and selling back for more than you paid for is NOT allowed.',

Those not in the approved list are discouraged from use as you may be penalized for using them. Use at your own risk. Those that are similar to a forbidden program are most likely forbidden as well.',
