title: Registration Codes (Updated)
---

New players to Eden will require a registration code to create an account. The purpose of registration codes is to prevent abuse of account creation. Similar to `!unstuck`, the `!getcode` command may be used by any player meeting both of the following criteria:

- accumulated 120 hours (5 days) of playtime and
- main job level 15 or greater.

The `!getcode` command will return a **7 digit, one-time use registration code that expires after 10 minutes** that should be given to new players wishing to create an account (or existing players wishing to create alternate accounts).

Existing players providing registration codes to new players will not be punished if the new player becomes banned for rule violations. Requesting a registration code repeatedly for the purpose of mass account creation is prohibited, even if done over the course of several weeks.
