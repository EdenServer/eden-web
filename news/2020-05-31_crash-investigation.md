We have heard your voices about crash related issues on Eden, especially with **Dynamis** and **Assault** zones and are still working to shore up a few more of them. It is taking an extended period to resolve the problems because we cannot reproduce them in test and need to explore code fixes over time. There are several expected crash fixes live right now and we are gathering data on their effectiveness. In the next few weeks, we hope to conclude our focused crash investigations, and then get back to more new content and more bug fixes.
