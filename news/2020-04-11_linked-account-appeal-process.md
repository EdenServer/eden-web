title: Linked Account Appeal Process
---

Pursuant to the announcement of Eden to be more welcoming / forgiving of player transgressions, we are opening up an appeals processes for players whose accounts were permanently banned due to being linked to another account that was found guilty of committing bannable offenses.

The account belonging to the character caught breaking rules will always experience the punishment appropriate for the rule that was broken, regardless of which person was in control at the time. We highly recommend you do not share your account under any circumstances.

The burden of proof is on the player(s) involved. It will be up to them to provide adequate proof that it was a different person who was caught cheating AND that you were unaware / had no reasonable way of suspecting that player may have been cheating. You should not be sharing an account with someone whom you know is cheating, or even someone whom you suspect might be cheating. If you later discover they are cheating and have previously shared your account with them, report this behavior immediately via in-game helpdesk ticket. Reporting this behavior when you discover it is encouraged and will drastically improve your chances of a favorable outcome.

At this time we are only considering appeals for accounts which were granted permanent bans due to being linked to the account of an offender.

Appeals can be directed to [gmteam.edenxi@gmail.com](mailto:gmteam.edenxi@gmail.com)
