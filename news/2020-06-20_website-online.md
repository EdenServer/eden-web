Eden's new and improved website and tools are now live with **Godmode's** redesign.

Constructive feedback, bug reports, and feature requests are appreciated and can be submitted by creating an issue in [the website GitHub](https://github.com/EdenServer/eden-web/issues).

If you are an artist and would like to contribute design or graphics please create an issue in GitHub or make a pull request with the new content.
