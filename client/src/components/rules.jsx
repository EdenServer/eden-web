          Listed here is a list of formal rules. It will be expanded upon and
          modified in the future so please stay as current as realistically
          possible with them. If you see someone breaking the rules,{' '}
          <b>
            <u>please do not report them in public forums like Discord</u>
          </b>
          . Either let them know they should stop, or call a GM using the in
          game Help Desk. Staff takes these reports seriously and we follow up
          on each one, but we do not want anybody shamed publicly for things
          they are simply suspected of. Once staff concludes if they are
          cheating or not, we will take appropriate action.

          Regarding behavior: we don&apos;t have an all inclusive code of
          conduct manual for you to read so use common sense. If you are doing
          something that would have gotten you banned or in trouble on retail,
          it is more than likely against the rules here too. If you are doing
          inappropriate things that you wouldn&apos;t do to your friends--I
          would think twice about that too. Finally, if a GM asks you to stop a
          behavior--saying &quot;it isn&apos;t in the rules&quot; is not a valid
          excuse for ignoring the GM.

          We give our GMs the responsibility to uphold rules in the essence of
          fair play as well as to ensure that other&apos;s play experience is
          not effected negatively, not all rules will be listed as some must be
          handled on a case by case basis, Our GM staff upholds communication
          between themselves in order to ensure a consistency in policy and has
          measures to ensure that this does not get abused,{' '}
          <b>
            ALL GM requests must be upheld and if something is found to be wrong
            with a certain request it will be dealt with accordingly. In the
            event you feel a GM&apos;s judgement was off you may contact a
            council member via webform on the website tools

        <Card.Text>
          We want to promote a server that promotes teamwork first and foremost.
          Many of our development decisions including removing some quality of
          life enhancements are based on this tenant. We know some things can be
          annoying and time consuming but we feel like some of those things are
          unavoidable to provide a stronger feeling of community. Please report
          to the administration when you think there is something that we
          overlooked and would rather not have or rather have in the game.
        </Card.Text>
        <Card.Text>
          While not a rule, we would like to see stronger players encouraging
          and helping newer and weaker players in the form of: inviting them
          into your experience point parties, sharing non-secret information
          about monsters and drops, and more. When more people feel welcomed to
          this server we will all prosper.
