    <h4>Files</h4>
    <p>
      Here are a list of files that you'll need to review/edit in order to
      create a BCNM. I'll break down what needs to be done for each file section
      by section below. These files are listed by their relative path.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>
        Note: These are probably not the only files you'll need to review/edit.
        You'll also probably need to edit mobs, magic, skills, et. cetera.
        Editing mobs, magic, skills, and so on is beyond the scope of this
        tutorial. For an example I will be reviewing the BCNM "Under
        Observation".
      </i>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>scripts/globals/bcnm.lua</li>
      <li>
        scripts/zones/{`{zonename}`}/bcnms/{'{bcnmname'}
      </li>
      <li>sql/mob_spawn_points.sql</li>
      <li>sql/bcnm_battlefield.sql</li>
      <li>sql/bcnm_info.sql</li>
      <li>sql/bcnm_loot.sql</li>
      <li>sql/bcnm_treasure_chests.sql</li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <h5>scripts/globals/bcnm.lua</h5>
    <p>
      In this file you'll just need to make sure that your BCNM exists and it's
      connected to the right zone and orb ID. On line 13 you'll see an object
      called itemid_bcnmid_map. You're going to scroll down to the see the zone
      you need listed in the comment on the right and then you're going to make
      sure that your BCNMID and ORBID are added there. For Under Observation, we
      will look at the following line:
    </p>
    <pre className="gm_code-block">{block10}</pre>
    <p>
      The zone id is 139, the orb id is 1131, and the bcnm id is 12. These are
      all provided here. However if we wanted to add the BCNM Tails of Woe we
      would change this line to:
    </p>
    <pre className="gm_code-block">{block11}</pre>
    <p>
      Tails of Woe also uses orb id 1131 but its bcnm id is 1. To find an orb id
      you can query SQL for the name in the item_basic table. To find a bcnm id
      you can query SQL for the name in the bcnm_info table.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h5>scripts/zones/Horlais_Peak/bcnms/under_observation.lua</h5>
    <p>
      If this file doesn't exist you can pretty much copy and paste it from
      another file in the same zone. Just make sure to change the details in the
      top. If it does exist, then you're in luck! You probably won't need to
      edit it.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h5>sql/mob_spawn_points.sql</h5>
    <p>
      More than likely the mobs here are already in the correct position.
      However you'll need to verify that they have the right spawn points. In
      addition, if they are not behaving like they should, are not the correct
      mob or model, or are using the wrong skills or magic you'll probably need
      to edit the appropriate files/tables. (Editing mobs is beyond this
      tutorial.)
    </p>

    <br />
    <h5>sql/bcnm_battlefield.sql</h5>
    <p>
      This table includes monsters that spawn inside the BCNM. All of these
      columns will need to be verified.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>bcnmId: This is the id you've found in bcnm_info</li>
      <li>
        battlefieldNumber: Usually there is 1, 2, and 3. Make sure not to assign
        the same monsterId to more than one battlefield.
      </li>
      <li>monsterId: You can look up the monster ids in mob_spawn_points.</li>
      <li>
        conditions: This one is a bit trickier. This is the condition for the
        monster to spawn. It's an integer that we refer to as a mask. 1 means
        it's spawned when you enter the BCNM and 2 means it's required to win.
        Usually this column will be 3.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <h5>sql/bcnm_info.sql</h5>
    <p>
      This is the main table where you're going to get info of what you need for
      your code and other tables. The important rows to take note of are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        bcnmId: This is used to relate all of the other bcnm tables plus it will
        be important to add to the bcnm.lua
      </li>
      <li>
        name: This is what you need to make sure your scripts/zones/
        {`{zonename}`}/bcnms/{`{bcnmname}`} script is named if it isn't already
        included.
      </li>
      <li>
        fastestName, fastestTime: These are not needed to edit for BCNMs. Uou
        can disregard these columns.
      </li>
      <li>
        levelCap: Self-explainatory. This is the level cap of the BCNM. If there
        is no cap put 0 here.
      </li>
      <li>
        partySize: Self-explanatory. This is the maximum number of players that
        can enter the BCNM.
      </li>
      <li>lootDropId: This is the id of the loot rows in bcnm_loot</li>
      <li>
        rules: It is also a mask. You can view these masks in the BCRULES enum
        in battlefield.h but typically this number should be 15.
      </li>
      <li>
        isMission: Just make sure this is set as 0 for consistency for orb BCNMs
      </li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <h5>sql/bcnm_loot.sql</h5>
    <p>
      BCNMs contain treasure! In order for it to drop when you open the chest
      you need to make sure that there is something in this table. Under
      bcnm_info you'll see the column "lootDropId" You will use that to query
      bcnm_loot. In our example for Under Observation the lootDropId is 16. So
      we would query like this to validate the treasure is correct. "SELECT *
      FROM bcnm_loot WHERE lootdropid = 16;"
    </p>
    <p>
      You can have a group of items that only drops 1 item per group. This is
      identified by lootGroupId. The rolls column determines the likelyhood of
      getting the drop within that group. Max combined value is 1000. You'll
      review/edit/add this information to the bcnm_loot table.
      <br />
      <br />
      Example 1: A group that should drop either a flowerpot or an arcane 100%
      of the time with equal chance to drop both.
    </p>
    <pre className="gm_code-block">{block12}</pre>
    <p>
      Example 2: A group that should drop a item 30% of the time with equal
      chance for all items to drop.
    </p>
    <pre className="gm_code-block">{block13}</pre>
    <p>
      You'd also need to change the spawn points in npc_list for these npcs.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h5>sql/bcnm_treasure_chests.sql</h5>
    <p>
      Each BCNM needs a treasure chest for each instance of the battlefield.
      Typically there are three instances per battlefield area. To find the BCNM
      chests for Under Observation you can run this query "SELECT * FROM
      bcnm_treasure_chests WHERE bcnmid = 12;" You'll notice that it has an
      npcid. This id is found in the table npc_list. You want to use a treasure
      chest that no other bcnm uses. If you were to add Tails of Woe here then
      you would add the following lines in the bcnm_treasure_chests.sql file.
      You can also run this in your SQL viewer of choice.
    </p>
    <pre className="gm_code-block">{block14}</pre>
    <p>
      You'd also need to change the spawn points in npc_list for these npcs.
